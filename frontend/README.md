## Key Features

* Community Contributions: Empowering users to submit their own well-researched or firsthand animal facts, enriching the collective knowledge base.

* Expertly Curated: Our initial set of animal facts is extracted from verified sources, meticulously gathered through web scraping techniques using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

* Tech Stack: This robust platform is engineered using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), ensuring high performance and a responsive user experience.

## How To Use

* Some images may be blank because media type for that fact may not be a picture. 
* Facts are sorted most recent first.
* The user can click on an image or name to see an animal fact.
    * This will bring the user to the fact detail page where they have access to the wikipedia link for that animal, source material, and a media link related to the animal or fact.
* Users can search for animal by name, or be navigated to a random fact by clicking the "random fact" button in the navigation bar
* Users can also register or log in by pressing the buttons in the top right of the navigation bar at the top of the screen.
    * Registering and logging in gives users access to more features such as:
        * Fact creation
        * Liking facts
        * A user dashboard
        * Admin functionalities if logged in as admin
* Use the navigation on the bottom of the page to go to more facts.
